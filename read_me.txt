The code coverage shows the total % of coverage as a function of number of lines of code covered by tests.

We can see from the coverage report that, the source files have a 70.2 % coverage.
Covered instructions = 1658
Missed instructions = 225
Total instructions = 1883

The test files have a coverage of 56.2 %

Covered instructions = 270
Missed instructions = 210
Total instructions = 480

Overall, the entire Scribe project has a coverage of 81.6 %

Covered instructions = 1928
Missed instructions = 435
Total instructions = 2363
